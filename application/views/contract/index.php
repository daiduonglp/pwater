 In order for a contract to be formed, the parties must reach mutual assent (also called a meeting of the minds).

This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the "mirror image rule".

A bilateral contract is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a promise[4] or set of promises to each other., it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer.

The Uniform Commercial Code disposes of the mirror image rule in §2-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA
